Modified from Evan's Banksy pipeline to speed up anndata generation and streamline the process
https://github.com/jwweii/PyBanksy-Harmony/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

# To use
- Copy content in "workflow2_master" folder. 
- This streamlined version calls scripts in "workflow2_subworkflow" to run 3 processes automatically. 

# Note 
Currently referencing script as absolute path to the katmai folder - aka will not work out-of-box if copied to different places
